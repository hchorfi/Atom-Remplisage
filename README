                           ===============

1. List of files
   -------------

   The following files should be part of this package:

   blas.f
   lapack.f
   hfbtho_v200d.f90
   main_v200d.f900
   hfbtho_NAMELIST.dat
   COPYING
   Makefile
   README
   examples/
   examples/test_odd/
   examples/test_spherical/
   examples/test_temperature/
   examples/test_tho/

   The 4 sub-directories of examples/ contain the input files and the output
   files coresponding to the Tables 1-4 of the manuscript.


1. Compilation Instructions
   ------------------------

   a) Adapt the Makefile to your system.

      This includes:
       - choosing the compiler (variable: COMPILER)
       - setting the name of the compiler executable (variable: FORTRAN)
       - choosing optimized or debug mode (variable: DEBUG, value: TRUE or
         FALSE)
       - choosing to link to a pre-installed BLAS and LAPACK library
         (variable: ACML_LIBRARY, value: TRUE or FALSE). If ACML_LIBRARY=FALSE,
         the code will be compiled using the parts of the BLAS and LAPACK
         libraries shipped with the program.
       - choosing static versus dynamic linking (variable: STATIC_LIB, value:
         TRUE or FALSE)
       - setting the pre-processor option activating multithreading with
         OpenMP (variable: hide_openmp, value: 1 or 0)

   b) Compile.

      Simply type

           make

      in the command line of a terminal.

2. Running Instructions
   --------------------

      Run the code. The following shows what to type on a typical Linux
      terminal console (assuming bash shell):

           ./main < /dev/null >& [output_file]

      where [output_file] is a name of your choice that will contain the
      redirection of the standard output and standard error.

      The program will try to open the file called 'hfbtho_NAMELIST.dat',
      where the input data is located. If this file does not exist, an error
      message will be printed to the standard output, and the program will
      exit.

      The directory examples/ contains many examples of calculations with
      the corresponding input data and output. Just copy or link one of
      these files to hfbtho_NAMELIST.dat to test the code.

      Multi-threading is supported with OpenMP. To use, you must set the
      number of OpenMP threads using a command such as

           export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4

      (example using bash shell syntax).


3. Bugs
   ----

   Old versions (<4.4) and/or conflicting installations of the GNU compiler
   `gfortran' may cause erratic behavior of the code, depending on the
   platform.

   Building HFBTHO with OpenMP support and simultaneously linking to threaded
   BLAS and LAPACK libraries has caused race conditions with the Portland PGI
   compiler (all versions) and the Cray LibSci library. This seems to be a bug
   of the compiler.


4. Important remark: the SLy family of Skyrme forces
   ----------------

   Several benchmarks published in the CPC article describing HFBTHO version
   2.00d were made with the SLy4 and SLy5 Skyrme forces. Following a common
   practice at the time, we used the parameterizations of those forces as
   recommended by their authors. These unofficial parametrizations differ from
   what was published in Nucl. Phys. 635, 231 (1997). The program HFODD in its
   version 2.49t (CPC 183, 166 (2012)), used the same unofficial
   parametrizations for all SLy forces.

   In the next release of both HFBTHO and HFODD programs, it is anticipated
   that the implementation of the SLy family of Skyrme forces will be reverted
   to their published values. In preparation for this, we have given in the
   subroutine skforce of the file hfbtho_v200d.f90 (lines 1219 to 1296) the
   official parametrizations of all SLy forces. Users willing to use them
   should uncomment these lines and recompile the code before use.
